      "The RG2 Gripper helps you get the most out of your robots. The RG2 gripper can be easily combined with the Dual Quick Changer module. The Dual Quick Changer module reduces production time by handling more workpieces simultaneously. This module works on the same principle as the Quick Changer module. However, the Dual Quick Changer is designed to allow the simultaneous use of two gripper tools, e.g., one RG2 gripper and one RG6 gripper in parallel. Adjustable fingertips provide great gripping flexibility: customers can use one tool for different parts of the production process, thereby maximizing robot utilization. ",
